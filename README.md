This repository contains documentation and source code for the following research projects:
* A Framework for Indirect Reciprocity (literature review)
* Evolution of Strategies for Public Goods Games
* Impact of Network Topology on Cooperation in Public Goods Games

# A Framework for Indirect Reciprocity
The `ir-framework` directory contains a paper that provides a review of some of the research that has been conducted on indirect reciprocity.
# Evolution of Strategies for Public Goods Games
The `pgg-strat-evo` directory contains a research paper documenting the results of experiments on the evolution of indirectory reciprocity.
The source code used to conduct simulations whose results are documentaed in the paper is found in the `go` directory.  This directory also contains the source code for simulations on the impact of network topology on cooperation in public goods games (see nect section).
# Impact of Network Topology on Cooperation in Public Goods Games
The `graph-structure` directory contains a research paper documenting the results of experiments on the impact of network topology on cooperation in public goods games.
The source code used to conduct simulations whose results are documentaed in the paper is found in the `go` directory.  As noted above, this directory also includes the source code for simulations on the evolution of strategies for public goods games.
